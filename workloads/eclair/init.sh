# -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1: Use only the C1 JIT compiler, skipping C2 compilation
#   entirely. C2 runs expensive optimizations in background threads which get
#   repeated every time we restore the VM snapshot, reducing fuzzing speed.
#
# -XX:-BackgroundCompilation: Compile on the invoking thread instead of a
#   background compiler thread. The pre-snapshot warmup loop (see the scenario
#   `warmup` helper) then blocks until the hot methods are actually compiled, so
#   the compiled code is guaranteed to be in the snapshot rather than depending
#   on a background thread having run before the snapshot is taken.
#
# -XX:CompileThresholdScaling=0.1: Lower the JIT invocation threshold ~10x so
#   the warmup loop needs far fewer iterations to trigger compilation of the hot
#   message-handling path.
#
# -javaagent: Coverage agent that instruments bytecode and writes edge counters
#   to AFL shared memory via JNI.
